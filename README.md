## Difficulties

The difficulty levels are somewhat arbitary, but they typically follow this distribution:

- **Difficulty 0**: Mostly monosyllabic, sparsely disyllabic where there is an easy single-stroke brief for it; simple vocabulary.
- **Difficulty 1**: Increased proportion of disyllabic words; easy vocabulary.
- **Difficulty 2**: Mostly disylalbic or trisyllabic; average vocabulary; sparse presence of compounded, hyphenated, or fingerspelt words.
- **Difficulty 3**: Upper syllabic limit increased to four; wider vocabulary; sparse presence of compounded, hyphenated, or fingerspelt words.
- **Difficulty 4**: Unconstrained number of syllables; increased usage of rare vocabulary that might require fingerspelling; unrestricted usage of compounded, hyphenated, or fingerspelt words.

> Normal, typical writing rests between difficulty 2 and 3.

Additionally, there is also the "Incremental" difficulty, which is where the passage gradually gets harder either across paragraphs or sentences depending on the text's length. The difficulty spread will be specified.
